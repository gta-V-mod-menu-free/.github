## Vehicle spawning Options
In GTA 5 offline, you’ve got a wide variety of vehicles to choose from. You can make use of any car on the road and take it home. But the same does not hold true for GTA 5 online multiplayer game modes. There’s a set system of rules when it comes to the online game mode of GTA 5. Do whatever you wish, but you’ll have to pay for the consequence.

So for players who wish to stay clear of that path but are looking for sweet rides for themselves, Kiddion’s mod menu offers such gamers a simple solution. The tool assists such players by spawning their desired vehicles for them. By using the mod menu, you won’t be breaking any rules. At the same time, the anti-cheat systems of GTA 5 won’t be able to catch the mod since it stays undetected.

## Change Character
Under normal circumstances, gamers enter GTA 5 as the main character. There’s no other option to join the game without making use of these main characters. But that’s a thing of the past now, and Kiddion offers its users a safe alternative for that.

By making use of the mod menu, you’ll be able to enter the GTA 5 game world as someone other than the main character. Yes, we are talking about NPCs or Nonplayable Characters. You’ll have a wide variety of NPCs to choose from. Choose any NPC in the game; it’s all up to you.

Live your life as a normal character who’s not thrust into the limelight. You can choose to be a thief, a shop clerk, a cop, among many others.

## Unlimited Money
In the case of the offline game mode, money isn’t really an issue. But as stated earlier, the majority of the online GTA 5 servers follow set rules and regulations.

The creators of these servers ensure that whoever joins abide by the set rules. If a player is unruly or does whatever they wish to, these server admins do not take long to kick them out of the server.

But the Impulse mod menu has a feature that allows its users access to unlimited money even within such servers. Since the mod menu stays undetected, it offers a safe method for gamers to never go broke within the game. Also, the server admins or the anti-cheat systems of the game will not be able to detect it.

## ESP Cheat
The mod menu by Kiddion is quite infamous in the market for offering among the best tools in the game. One such example is that of the ESP.

Similar to how the hack works in other games such as CSGo, the ESP hack endows the user with the ability to see other players and NPCs through walls. That holds true for game items such as cars, weapons, and so on. You can even see players across the map, but that’ll leave you confused, so it’s better you stay away from doing so.

## Other features offered
The mod menu offers tons of cheats for its users. Notable mentions include Super Jump, God Mode, Weather, Protection, Teleportation, among others.

- Stats updated.
- Enhances bullet control. Updates in the time taken to fire bullets.
